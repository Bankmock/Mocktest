In theory, when these mosquitoes are released in high numbers, a dramatic reduction in the mosquito population should follow.

For example, the rusty patched bumblebee, which used to flourish in Ontario, is no longer found in all of Canada—in the U.S., it’s endangered. In a new paper published this week in the journal Science, researchers used a complex modeling process to (99) __________that their (100)__________ is driven in large part by climate change.Specifically, the scientists found that in areas that have become hotter in the last generation, or have experienced more extreme temperature swings, bumblebees are less abundant. In Europe, they are 17 percent less plentiful than they were in the early 20th century. The scientists examined the abundance of 66 species across the two continents."
